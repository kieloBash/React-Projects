    answer:
      "I have always wanted to work as an exhibition designer for a museum that embraces cultural changes and provides a sensory experience for its visitors. My degree helped me to develop key artistic and organisational skills, while the experience that I gained from working at my local museum has been the ideal preparation for a career in this field. I would relish the opportunity to be part of the team that works on the concepts for your upcoming exhibits and collections.",

    answer: "Although I haven't had the chance to gain work experience at an advertising agency yet, I have already created high level concepts that have been used by leading brands such as Marks & Spencer.

    question: "Give an example of when you have worked under pressure",
    answer: "During my work placement last year I faced various conflicting demands on my time due to the fact that my role was inter-departmental. One particular week, the pressures did threaten to get overwhelming as a number of key staff members were off sick. However, this allowed me to show that I could rise to the challenge. I left the company with praise from my peers as I always gave my best no matter what.",
